## About

Abstract, The NeoVim configuration to achieve the power of Modern IDE

![screenshot_welcome](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shaeinst/media/main/images/github-repositories/abstract/abstract-welcom.png)



## Features

- ```Project based config loading``` ( you can define configs in ```.__nvim__.lua``` file in the root of your working project so that you don't have to change config everytime you work on new/seperate project )
- ```Your own custom configs and Mappings``` (if you don't like Abstract's default config/mapping, you can change/override it on [override_defalut.lua](https://github.com/Abstract-IDE/Abstract/blob/main/lua/customs/override_defalut.lua) OR ```~/.__nvim__.lua``` file )
- ```Separate config file for each plugins``` each plugin has their own config file which is defined in lua/plugins directory
- ```Easily Disable plugin``` Abstract's using [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as plugin manager. conmmenting out ```config``` option from plugin options in [packer config file](https://github.com/Abstract-IDE/Abstract/blob/main/lua/plugins/packer_nvim.lua) will disable that plugin
- ```Easy Installation``` install Abstract with single command



## Getting Started

Abstract can be installed by just runing a script.


#### Prerequisites

  * neovim v0.7.2


#### Installation

single command to install Abstract
```bash
wget https://github.com/Abstract-IDE/Abstract/archive/refs/tags/v0.7.2.zip && unzip v0.7.2.zip && mv Abstract-0.7.2/ ~/.config/nvim
```
or if you want to install it by cloning
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Abstract-IDE/Abstract
$ cd Abstract
$ git checkout release-0.7.2
$ python setup.py
$ cd ~/.config/nvim && git checkout release-0.7.2
```
pass ```--delete 1``` as an argument if you don't want to keep ```.git```, ```README.md```, ```LICENSE``` and ```setup.py``` file.
Example:
```bash
python setup.py --delete 1
```

NOTE1:
it could take some time depending on you connection (it's going to install plugins and some LSs).<br>
So, be patient and follow the output throw by setup.py script<br><br>
NOTE2:
only some LSs are going to be installed. for more, install with [LspInstall](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) <br>
for example: to install C/C++'s LS ``` :LspInstall clangd ```
<br><br>



## Usage

every one has their own favourite configs and keybindings. Abstract try its best to provide likable configs and mapping.
<br>
so in case you don't like to use mapping or configs by Abstract, you can change it in [override_defalut.lua](https://github.com/Abstract-IDE/Abstract/blob/main/lua/customs/override_defalut.lua) file. <br>
